# PoolpartyConnector

The Project aim at providing a content repository connector for The PoolParty Thesaurus Server

It allows to make use of the several Services Offered by PoolParty e.g. Content Categorization, Content Enrichment, and so son

It also provide a Service to Cache the entire thesarus with automated update for fast lookup


Although it has specific features for the Dspace content repository, as it was the original system with which it was developped,
care has been taken to separate it away from the generic functionality that any content repository may make use of.

In the future both part will be pushed in different sub-project, thereby creating a project of multiple content repository integration
